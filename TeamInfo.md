## Project Summary

The Flight Recommendation Feature enhances our application's functionality by allowing passengers to input their travel details, including departure location, destination, and departure time. Based on this information, the application leverages data on airport names, airline companies, and flight numbers, ranking them in descending order of on-time performance. This empowers passengers to make informed choices, giving priority to flights with the best punctuality. This feature not only provides convenience but also contributes to a smoother travel experience, aligning with our commitment to delivering valuable travel insights and services.

Our website can offer accurate flight delay-data search and flight recommendation based on time accuracy, which will improve tour experience of passagers. Delay-data visualization part generates an explicit analysis of delay reasons, which will make it clear to schedule more accurate flights. There is a similar websit: https://github.com/lrakai/us-flight-delays. Our application refers to it, but has two other functions: Delay-history data search and Delay-history data analysis visualization, so we can say the github repo is a part function of our application.
